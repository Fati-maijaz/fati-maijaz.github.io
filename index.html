    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Fatima, a prospective computer science student with a growing interest in cybersecurity.
      I love exploring how technology works behind the scenes and learning how thoughtful design and security
      practices can keep users safe in the digital world.

  <h1>Common Password Mistakes and Why They Matter in Cybersecurity</h1>

  <p>
    Cybersecurity is a fascinating field that blends technology and human behavior. While studying its basics,
    I noticed that many security breaches are caused not by advanced hacking techniques, but by simple
    human habits—especially weak passwords.
  </p>

  <h2>The Problem with Weak Passwords</h2>
  <p>
    Many people use easy-to-remember passwords like "123456" or "password". These are extremely
    vulnerable because attackers can guess them in seconds using automated tools.
  </p>

  <h2>Password Reuse Risks</h2>
  <p>
    Reusing the same password across multiple websites is another common mistake. If one site is breached,
    all accounts using the same password are at risk. This shows how cybersecurity often depends more
    on human behavior than just technical solutions.
  </p>

  <h2>Creating Strong Passwords</h2>
  <p>
    A strong password is long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    Using a password manager can help create and remember unique passwords for every account.
  </p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Learning about cybersecurity has taught me that safety online starts with simple, everyday choices.
    Even the most advanced systems can be compromised if users are careless. This insight has deepened
    my interest in the field and motivates me to continue learning and sharing knowledge about digital safety.
