    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m <strong>Fatima Maijaz</strong>, an aspiring computer science student with a passion for 
      cybersecurity and digital safety. I love exploring how technology works behind the scenes, 
      understanding what keeps systems safe, and sharing what I learn with others. 
      I also enjoy adding a touch of creativity and style to my projects — because learning should be fun!

    <h1>Cybersecurity Basics: Why Simple Habits Matter</h1>
    <p>
      When people think about cybersecurity, they often imagine complex hacking techniques and high-tech 
      code. But in reality, the most common security breaches often come from everyday habits. 
      Passwords, public Wi-Fi usage, and even simple clicks on suspicious links can create big risks.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Weak Passwords</h2>
    <p>
      Weak passwords are one of the easiest ways for accounts to be compromised. 
      Using “123456” or “password” might be convenient, but automated tools can guess them almost instantly. 
      Even adding a capital letter isn’t always enough — length and randomness are key.
    </p>

    <h3>Tips for Strong Passwords:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use at least 12 characters, combining letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
      <li>Consider using a <strong>passphrase</strong> — a sentence you can remember but is hard to guess.</li>
      <li>Use a <strong>password manager</strong> to keep unique passwords for every account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Password Reuse</h2>
    <p>
      Reusing passwords across multiple websites is a major security risk. 
      If one site is breached, all other accounts using the same password can be compromised. 
      It’s a common mistake that’s easy to avoid with careful planning.
    </p>

    <h3>Tip:</h3>
    <p>Keep a unique password for each account. Password managers are lifesavers for this!</p>

    <h2>3. Phishing and Suspicious Links</h2>
    <p>
      Phishing attacks trick users into giving away personal information. They often arrive 
      via emails or messages that look real but are fake. Even the savviest users can get tricked.
    </p>

    <h3>Tip:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Always check the sender’s email carefully.</li>
      <li>Hover over links to see where they really lead before clicking.</li>
      <li>Enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Public Wi-Fi Risks</h2>
    <p>
      Free Wi-Fi is convenient but often insecure. Hackers can intercept information sent over public networks.
    </p>

    <h3>Tip:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a VPN when connecting to public networks.</li>
      <li>Avoid logging into sensitive accounts on public Wi-Fi.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Learning cybersecurity basics has taught me that safety often starts with small, everyday choices. 
      Even advanced technology cannot fully protect users if they neglect simple habits. 
      This understanding has fueled my curiosity and motivates me to keep learning and sharing knowledge 
      about digital safety.
